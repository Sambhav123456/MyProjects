                <li>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi born on 2 October 1869</li>
                <li>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, western India</li>
                <li> He set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive
                    land-tax and discrimination.</li>
                <li> Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for
                    easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending
                    untouchability, and above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.</li>
                <li>Gandhi ji adopted the Indian loincloth, or short dhoti and, in the winter, a shawl, both woven with
                    yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel, or charkha, as a mark of identification with
                    India's rural poor. </li>
                <li>He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community, ate simple vegetarian food, and
                    undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest. </li>
                <li>Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the
                    British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930, and later in calling for
                    the British to Quit India in 1942.</li>
                <li>He was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both South Africa and India.</li>
                <li>dies on 30 January 1948 at the age of 78</li>
            </ul>
